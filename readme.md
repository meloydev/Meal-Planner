## Installation

#### git clone https://github.com/meloydev/Meal-Planner.git

#### npm Install
 
## Motivation

This app was created by me for a local gym owner who originally wanted a way to created meal plans for his clients, this quickly
turned into more request as he thought of more feature he wanted. It also gave me a good way to practice Node.js and Electron app building
 
## State of the project
I would put the state of this project in Beta, items that need addressed are:

1. Client side validation.
2. Password recovery.
3. Visual tweaks for added consistency.
4. Currently have 3 ways the app notifies users of activities.
5. Error handling on some items.
6. Client window is not responsive design.
7. Meal plan .docx template should be user modifiable.
8. When adding food items, check for duplicates
9. And many more..
